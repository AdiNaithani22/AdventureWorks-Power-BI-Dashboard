# AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard developed for AdventureWorks, a fictional global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.

## Project Overview

The AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard is designed to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns. It compares regional performance, analyzes product-level trends, and identifies high-value customers using data provided in CSV files.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes key metrics such as revenue, profit, orders, and return rate.
- **Data Model**: Relational data model built using Power BI, connecting multiple data sources.
- **DAX Calculations**: Uses Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for calculated columns and measures to provide insights.
- **Visual Reports**: Interactive reports and visualizations to analyze product categories and top-performing products.
## Usage

- Use the dashboard to interact with various visual elements, filter data, and gain insights into the AdventureWorks sales and customer data.
- Analyze trends using the time slider and explore specific product categories through the interactive filters.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project includes:

- **Sales Transactions**: Information about product sales and revenue.
- **Customer Details**: Demographic information about customers.
- **Product Information**: Details about products and categories.
- **Sales Territories**: Geographic information about sales regions.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Connect and transform raw data using Power BI's query editor.
- Build a relational data model and define relationships using primary and foreign keys.
- Create calculated columns and measures with DAX for complex data analysis.
- Design professional-quality dashboards and reports with interactive visualizations.
